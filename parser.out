Unused terminals:

    COW
    DOG
    NAME
    SPACE
    THEDOG

Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> program
Rule 1     program -> CAT
Rule 2     program -> program CAT

Terminals, with rules where they appear

CAT                  : 1 2
COW                  : 
DOG                  : 
NAME                 : 
SPACE                : 
THEDOG               : 
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

program              : 2 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . program
    (1) program -> . CAT
    (2) program -> . program CAT

    CAT             shift and go to state 2

    program                        shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> program .
    (2) program -> program . CAT

    CAT             shift and go to state 3


state 2

    (1) program -> CAT .

    CAT             reduce using rule 1 (program -> CAT .)
    $end            reduce using rule 1 (program -> CAT .)


state 3

    (2) program -> program CAT .

    CAT             reduce using rule 2 (program -> program CAT .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (program -> program CAT .)
